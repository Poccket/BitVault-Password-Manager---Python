# BitVault Password Manager ðŸ”‘
Basic password manager with no current GUI. It is unfinished; encryption and an account system are in the works.
This started as a simple personal project to get me back to Python but I'd like to keep it going further as an open-source project that some may use for their day to day
password storage. 

# Plan ðŸ“…
1. My current plan for encryption is to use cryptography library's 'fernet' which will give 128 bit encryption to user passwords.
