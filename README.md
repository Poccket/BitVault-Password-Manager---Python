# BitVault Password Manager ðŸ”‘
Basic password manager with no current GUI. It is unfinished; encryption and an account system are in the works.
This started as a simple personal project to get me back to Python but I'd like to keep it going further as an open-source project that some may use for their day to day
password storage. 

# Plan ðŸ“…
1. My current plan for encryption is to use cryptography library's 'fernet' which will give 128 bit encryption to user passwords. 
2. Develop the Password Manager GUI and probably add a Universial Installer for the software along with the included Fonts
3. Implement CPU hashing in the near future
4.  Release 1.0 by March-April window
