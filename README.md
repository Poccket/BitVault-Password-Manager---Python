# BitVault Password Manager ðŸ”‘
______________________________
Basic password manager with no current G.U.I. It is unfinished; encryption and an account system are in the works.
This started as a simple personal project to get me back to Python but I'd like to keep it going further as an OpenSource project that some may use for their day to day
password storage. 

# Plan ðŸ“…
My current plan for encryption is to use cryptography library's 'fernet' which will give 128 bit encryption to user passwords.
